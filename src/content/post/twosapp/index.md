Hello Guys! How are you doing?

Today I'm going to show you a new tool that I found via @joseli.to on @bluesky (thank you Joselito, this tool totally made my week). The tool is named TwosApp. TwosApp is an organization tool and productivity tool that allows you to create "THINGS". It was created by Parker Klein, a former Google engineer who developed this tool for about six years before launching, because he wanted the tool to be very complete before letting other users access (Or because he doesn't want to have trouble with Google and Google Keep, but shhh). So, TwosApp is a Things Tool..

**But, what things? ðŸ¤”**

#### Many things!

TwosApp plays with the meaning of the word "Things", using Thing as a broad and abstract concept that has a lot of small types of "thing". So, first I'm going to talk about the "Thing" types. We have six types of things, they are:
- Dash - Just a dash, some things don't need to be that special;
- To-Do - This is some thing achievable;
- Number - Some things must be ordered, or are just ordered because of they concept;
- Note - These things record date and time values;
- Bullet - Just a bullet, like the dash, this one doesn't need to be that special;
- Sublist - Some things have a "Bigger" or a "Smaller" thing related. Use it for these. 
- Divider -  This one is for dividing your things, basically.
These are the things types.

Considering that, let's talk about the other funcionalities of TwosApp.

The TwosApp application also has:
- Lists - For lots of thing you create a list of things!
- Calendar - They have a specific list for each day, for taking diary notes basically;
- Stars - Some things are more specific than others; the Stars section is for archiving the most important things, the ones you don't want to forget easily;
- To-Do's - This one is for To-do things, because you want to complete these To-Do's one day, don't you?
- Recent Lists - See your last accessed's list easily with this functionality;
- GAMEFICATION - Oh yeah boy, TwosApp has a gamefication funcionality that you can earn badges using your app, how cool is that?
- World, wait, World? - MR WORLDWIDE, this section permits you to reach other user's lists, templates and things. You can use they public material for improve your organization, and you can share you methods for organization there to!

Thanks again Joselito for the recommendation, I'm using this tool A LOT, and I expect you to use it too. Farewell ðŸ˜½.
